    - GTK1 is no longer maintained by Lazarus team, but patches are accepted.
    - fpGUI: LCL interface now supports all components on the standard page.
    - QT support for Haiku
    - Layout and autosizing is now more consistent across widgetsets,
      overhead was reduced, improved cross platform layouts and complex forms.
    - Added gif reader
    - TLazIntfImage: New function AlphaBlend, which can alpha blend an intfimage
      into another, using a separate intfimage as the alpha channel.
    - Unit chart and its component TBarChar are deprecated in favor of new
      package TAChartLazarusPkg.
  * IDE:
    - Support of FPC resources: {$R *.lfm} instead of {$i unit1.lrs}.
    - The Delphi converter has improved a lot.
    - Build modes, build macros and conditionals now allows different sets of
      compiler options for projects and packages.
    - Editor improvements:
      + Hiding (Folding) of comments in Pascal source.
      + Allow Multiple Source-Editor Windows
      + Allow several Views of the same Source
      + User-defined color-schemes.
      + Identifier-completion pop-up is now resizable
    - Project compiler options can now be saved as default for new projects.

      + save/restore of the form window state in the project session
      + skip snapping when Alt key is pressed
    - When creating a new project the default unit output directory is now
      lib/$(TargetCPU)-$(TargetOS). Target file name is project1. This has no
      impact on old projects.
    - IDE now preserves the line endings of source files (it uses the line
      ending of the first line, it does not preserve mixed line endings).
    - You can now quickly switch between several versions / branches of packages
      by defining the preferred package file name for each dependency.
    - You can now use the IDE directive %H- to hide individual hints, notes and
      warnings.
    - The IDE can be made dockable. Install either the package AnchorDockingDsgn
      or EasyDockMgrDsgn.

    - Single Instruction step (over/into)
    - UI Improvements: Toolbars for Watches, Breakpoints, Disassembler
    - Watches: Enabled display formats (mem-dump, Hex, Default, ..)

    - Improved reaction speed: It is possible to continue stepping without
      having to wait for all watches, locals, ... to be evaluated
  * Components:
    - IDE got some options to become easier for students and pupils and there is
      a new package EducationLaz adding options to hide complex parts of the IDE

      series, axis transformations, interactive tools, 6 new demos and other
      improvements

    (Closes: Bug#620108)

    <p><font size="+2">Introduction</font>
    <p>DCPcrypt is a collection of cryptographic components for the Borland Delphi(tm), C++ Builder(tm) and Kylix(tm) programming languages. The supported versions are Delphi 4, 5, 6 and 7, C++ Builder (3?), 4, 5, 6 and Kylix 1 (untested) and 2.
    <p>The idea behind DCPcrypt is that it should be possible to "drop in" any algorithm implementation to replace another with minimum or no code changes. To aid in this goal all cryptographic components are descended from one of several base classes, TDCP_cipher for encryption algorithms and TDCP_hash for message digest algorithms.

    <p><font size="+2">What's New</font>
    <p>Changes since DCPcrypt v2 Beta 2:
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected C++ Builder compilation problem.
    </ul>
    <p>Changes since DCPcrypt v2 Beta 1:
    <ul>
      <li>Renamed source code files for hashes and ciphers to DCPxxx.pas
      <li>Change the format of Cipher.InitStr so that the hash algorithm used to generate the key is explicitly specified. In order to get the same functionality as before, use TDCP_sha1. e.g. Cipher.InitStr('Hello World',TDCP_sha1);
      <li>Block ciphers are now inherited from an intermediate component that implements the block size specific chaining mode encryption routines.
      <li>Remove the internal component registration, it was more hassle than it was worth. If there is a demand for this to be put back then I might...     
      <li>Added the full range of operation modes for Haval. By changing the defines at the top of DCPhaval.pas you can specify the number of passes and the output hash size.
      <li>Added the Tiger hash algorithm (192bit digest).
      <li>Changed the name of the file containing TDCP_ripemd160 for consistency to DCPripemd160 from DCPrmd160.
      <li>GOST no longer appears on the component palette pending verifying what the actual standard is (the code is still included however).
      <li>Added the RipeMD-128 hash algorithm (128bit digest).
      <li>Added the Serpent block cipher (AES finalist).
      <li>Added the SHA-256,384,512 hash algorithms (256, 384, 512bit digest respectively).
      <li>Added CTR chaining mode to all block ciphers.
    </ul>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td width="120">Delphi</td>
        <td>Open the appropriate package, DCPdelphiX.dpk where X is your version of Delphi (either 4, 5 or 6). Then press the install button.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="120">C++ Builder</td>
        <td>Create a new design time package and add all the .pas files from the DCPcrypt2.zip archive including all those in the Ciphers and Hashes subdirectories. Then press the install button.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="120">Kylix</td>
        <td>Open the DCPkylix.dpk package and then press the install button (note: Kylix 1 users may need to create a new package as with C++ Builder as this is a Kylix 2 package).</td>
      </tr>
    <table>
    <p>You may need to add the directory containing DCPcrypt (and the Ciphers and Hashes subdirectories) to your library search path (found under Environment Options).
    <p>Once installed you will find two extra pages of components on your component palette, namely DCPciphers and DCPhashes. You can now place these components onto the form of your application to start using the algorithms.
    <p>&nbsp;
    <p><font size="+2">Usage</font>
    <p>Please note that an appreciation of the basic principles of encryption/decryption and key management is needed to ensure the correct usage of the ciphers implemented within this package. A good introduction on this subject is provided by Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" (ISBN: 0-471-11709-9) also see the NIST publication SP800-38A for information on the block cipher chaining modes.

    <p>* although the quoted maximum key size may extremely large it doen't mean that the algorithm is secure to the same level.<br>
       ** a 64bit key is used for DES then every 8th bit is discarded (parity) so the effective size is 56 bits.
